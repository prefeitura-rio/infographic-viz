Because the covers were meant to be evaluated at a glance — as if you were passing by them in a bookstore or library — this analysis does not completely account for the complexity and fluidity of gender, race, and ethnicity. This is an imperfect method, but by categorizing the covers, we can see important trends within the romance industry — an industry that overwhelmingly features white, cisgender, and heterosexual stories and excludes more marginalized communities."
